## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

The Sunnyside Agency Landing Page was a good step up that gave me a good challenge, especially with the header and using JavaScript to toggle the header menu along with the features section. The features section was quite tricky and required a of decision making. Should I use flexbox or should I use grid? I was able to achieve the layout using grid and changing the order on the 768px breakpoint.

The rest of the layout was pretty straightforward.
